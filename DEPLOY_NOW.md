## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Failed to fetch video info"

**Check:**
1. Open Railway ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí "Deployments"
2. Click latest deployment ‚Üí "View Logs"
3. Look for errors

**Common fixes:**
- Make sure Root Directory is set to `backend` in Railway
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel matches your Railway URL exactly
- Check that Railway deployment succeeded (green checkmark)

### Error: CORS blocked in browser console

**Fix:**
1. Open Railway ‚Üí Variables
2. Make sure `FRONTEND_URL` has your exact Vercel URL
3. No trailing slash: ‚úÖ `https://xyz.vercel.app` ‚ùå `https://xyz.vercel.app/`
4. Wait 30 seconds for Railway to redeploy

### Error: "Cannot GET /" on Railway URL

**This is normal!** Your backend API doesn't have a homepage.
- Try: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/health`
- You should see: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}`

### Video download fails

**Try:**
1. Use a different YouTube video URL
2. Check Railway logs for errors
3. Make sure video is not age-restricted or private
4. Update ytdl-core: 
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm update ytdl-core
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update ytdl-core"
   git push
   ```
